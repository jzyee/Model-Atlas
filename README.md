>**Abstract:** As there are now millions of publicly available neural networks, searching and analyzing large model repositories becomes increasingly important.
> Navigating so many models requires an *atlas*, but as most models are poorly documented charting such an atlas is challenging.
> To explore the hidden potential of model repositories, we chart a preliminary atlas representing the documented fraction of Hugging Face.
> It provides stunning visualizations of the model landscape and evolution. We demonstrate several applications of this atlas including predicting model attributes (e.g., accuracy),
>  and analyzing trends in computer vision models. However, as the current atlas remains incomplete, we propose a method for charting undocumented regions.
> Specifically, we identify high-confidence structural priors based on dominant real-world model training practices.
> Leveraging these priors, our approach enables accurate mapping of previously undocumented areas of the atlas.
> We publicly release our datasets, code, and interactive atlas.
